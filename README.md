Hello world!
### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

1. becae r g b are floats because color values are continuous (0.0 ~ 1.0) and need decimals for smooth color changes.

2. because the bounce is an int because it counts whole bounce events—something you can’t do with fractions.

3. it shows"All compiler errors have to be fixed before you can enter playmode!UnityEditor.SceneView:ShowCompileErrorNotification ()， it means there something wrong of code like missing the symbol “ ； ”

### w3

1. table 19 : The SetLightDimness method takes the player’s sanity level as a float 0 ~ 100 , and because of it doesnt need a output so it has a void return type since it directly changes the room’s light brightness.

2. Classes are like cookie cutters, and Components are the cookies made from them.
Member variables are the ingredients that define each cookie’s traits, and methods are the actions it can do.

3. 
The balls get too bright because each bounce keeps adding light intensity with no limit.


### w4

1.   table 19 
  _isGrounded is a member variable of type boolean, used to track whether the character is on the ground.And the code will call a method to check When both the player click space and the cat is "isgrounded" , the if statement will be ture. And the last code  means when the cat start jumping the 'isgrounded' will be false, it limits jump of cat.

2. tablet 19
 ball and cat need rigidbody because they need phyiscal body when the cat hit the ball. the goal don't need a phyiscal body and it will check trigger because it need to record when the ball pass through the goal. during I add the component I find that the cat is floating on the sky. and the problem of this bug is that the size of collidor is too large after i edit the size the collider the cat will not floating.
